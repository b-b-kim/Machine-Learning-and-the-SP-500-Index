# Machine-Learning-and-the-SP-500-Index

Can machine learning be used to predict stocks that will outperform the S&P 500 stock index?  Logistic Regression and Random Forest were used to examine the relative performance of several hundred stocks' versus the SP500.  GridsearchCV was also incorporated to tune hyperparameters.  

Multiple data sources were used to help predict outperformance.  They were 30 year mortgage rates, Case-Shiller's home price index, and NOAA's billion dollar disaster index.

This repo contains the jupyter notebooks used for data scraping, wrangling and analysis.
