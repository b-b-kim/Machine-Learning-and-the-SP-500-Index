# Machine-Learning-and-the-SP-500-Index

Can machine learning be used to predict stocks that will outperform the S&P 500 stock index?  Logistic Regression and Random Forest were used to examine several hundred stocks' performance versus the SP500.  GridsearchCV was also incorporated to tune hyperparameters.  

Other data sources were also used to help predict outperformance.  They were 30 year mortgage rates, Case-Shiller's home price index, and NOAA's billion dollar disaster index.

This repo contains the jupyter notebooks used for data scraping, wrangling and analysis.
